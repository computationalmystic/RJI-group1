For our application we will be using the idealo image classifier, which outputs both an aesthetic and technical score for each image. Depending on our time constraints we will begin to implement a method to train the model; however, this will be rather time consuming as we will need to collect a large amount of data in the form of a human score for each image. The major drawback with our current implementation is the inability to tailor the assessmnet metric to certain genres of photography, which will hinder the assessment of smaller collections such as albums and result in less accurate scores. As such, our idea is to have two scoring modes which can be selected by the user: absolute and relative. In the case of absolute scoring, all of the photos will be judged based on a certain predetermined keep/toss scoring cutoff; this will work well for larger collections of images that do not share the same genre. On the other hand, relative scoring will use some basic statistical analysis to find the mean and standard deviation of the scores, and from this we will decide which images to keep/toss based on the data for that specific submission.
